Bye-bye
Boy, bye, hmm
Hmm
Bye-bye
Boy, bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
This ain't the first time
I've been hostage to these tears
I can't believe I'm finally
moving through my fears
At least I know how hard
we tried, both you and me
Didn't we? Didn't we?
So I grab my stuff
Courtney just pulled up
in the drive way
It's time
Bye-bye
Boy, bye
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
Bye-bye
I'm taking what's mine, yeah
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
You know? I'm stronger
than I think
Usually, I'd join you
on the floor
But this dance ain't for me
Boy, just turn the music up
Maybe someday we'll look
back with love
Didn't think you'd lose me
Now it's just too
late to choose me
So I grab my stuff
(Ooh)
Courtney just pulled up
in the drive way
It's time
(It's time)
Bye-bye
Boy, bye
(Boy, bye)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
Bye-bye
I'm taking what's mine, yeah
(Taking what's mine)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
Now it's certainly bittersweet
This hook feels too hard to sing
But it's better than repeat
(Than repeat, than repeat,
than repeat)
Bye-bye
(Bye-bye)
Boy, bye
(Boy, bye)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh, yeah
(Bye)
Bye-bye
(Bye-bye)
I'm taking what's mine, yeah
(Taking what's mine; Ooh)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh, yeah
(Ooh)
Bye-bye
(Bye-bye)
Boy, bye
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh, yeah
(Bye)
Bye-bye
(Bye-bye)
I'm taking what's mine, yeah
(I'm taking what's mine, yeah)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh, yeah
